I used mapbox to create my map style, and added terrain layers to my map using mapbox. I also added in my dataset within mapbox. I used p5.js to display my code.

# Reflective Analysis:
I initially wanted to figure out how to map terrain and make the terrain more exxagerated. To add interactivity, I added a search bar where you can search countries, provinces and cities. I also added in data on Indian Residential Schools in Canada and added them to the search function. I was interested in the locations of residential schools across Canada so I added an interactive element, where you can see the name of the Residential School as well as the opening date when you click on it. I thought that it was very important to see how widespread Indian Residential Schools were across Canada, in the attempts to assimilate indigenous peoples. Within residential schools, indigenous children were often mistreated, dealing with things such as malnutrition, verbal/physical/sexual abuse, illnesses, and removal of cultures and traditions. (Miller, 1996). It is shocking to see how many Residential Schools were inacted (and so quickly!) across Canada.
